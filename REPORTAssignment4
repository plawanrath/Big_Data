I have written 3 java files, WordCount, WordCountInMapper and CoOccuranceFrequency

For Part 1, I ran the commands as follows :

First I ran WordCount with regular combiner and recorded the running times on all 6 files:

hadoop jar InMappers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar WordCount hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030 
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/ArtOfWar.txt file is 18594ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/DevilsDictionary.txt file is 16657ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/Encyclopedia.txt file is 16860ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/NotebookOfLDV.txt file is 18714ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/OutlineOfScience.txt file is 17596ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/SherlockHolmes.txt file is 16583ms

Then I ran the WordCount with InMapper combiner and recorded the running times on all 6 files:

hadoop jar InMappers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar WordCountInMapper hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030 
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/ArtOfWar.txt file is 18594ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/DevilsDictionary.txt file is 15664ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/Encyclopedia.txt file is 16637ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/NotebookOfLDV.txt file is 16601ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/OutlineOfScience.txt file is 17633ms
Time taken to run on hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/SherlockHolmes.txt file is 17617ms

Clearly, we can see that although the time taken is more or less same, yet the one with In Mapper combiner gives slightly better running time or runs slightly faster than the one with regular combiner.



For Part 2, I wrote the CoOccuranceFrequency class. A point to be noted is that since, we need to ignore stop_words all the time, it was not necessary to pass a file containing stop words. Instead I create and instantiate a hashSet with the stop words to be ignored. The only additional parameter apart from source and destination, that is required by the program is the length parameter.
I ran the following commands on all 6 files in HDFS to get Co Occurance frequencies of the 6 files.

hadoop jar InMappers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar CoOccuranceFrequency hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/ArtOfWar.txt hdfs://cshadoop1/user/pkr140030/CoOFAow -length 5
